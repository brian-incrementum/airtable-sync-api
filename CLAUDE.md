# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an Airtable sync API project. The repository is currently empty and ready for initial development.

## Development Setup

*Note: Commands will be added here once the project structure is established*

## Architecture

*Note: Architecture details will be documented here as the codebase develops*

## Important Notes

- This is a new project - initial setup and architecture decisions need to be made
- Consider the target use case for Airtable synchronization when making architectural decisions
- API design should prioritize data consistency and error handling for sync operations
